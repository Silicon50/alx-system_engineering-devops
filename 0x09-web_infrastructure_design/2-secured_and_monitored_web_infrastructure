Additional Elements
- 3 Firewalls: They filter network traffic in and out of the machine
- 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS: This encrypts the traffic such that if it is intercepted, it cannot be read
- 3 Monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services): it keep an eye on various metrics to ensure to smooth operation

Monitoring Setup
- it is composed of a client collecting data and sending it to the monitoring system
- Monitoring is configured to collect web server data and triggers an alert if QPS (Query Per Second) is getting out of control

Problems
- Terminating SSL at load balancer level leaves traffic between the load balancer and web servers unencrypted and exposed to attack
- If the only MySQL server (The Master) capable accepting writes goes down, the application can no longer write to the database.
- Servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) could cause maintenance problems because if maintenace is performed on a server for a specific component, it will affect other components that are on it and can be a problem because their consumption will not grow the same way between each of them
- Load-balancer is a single point of failure
