Additional Elements
-two servers 
- Web Servers were added so that there will be redundancy with the added server
- One Load Balancer (HAProxy)which distribute the traffic between the two servers

Load Balancer Configuration
Load balancer is configured to have an active-active setup. Active-Active setup deploy two or more active system instances and can be used to improve scalability as well as provide high availability. In active-active deployments, all instances handle requests concurrently while Active-passive solutions deploy an active instance that handles requests and a passive instance that is on standby.

Data Synchronization
- The MySQL Master-Replica cluster used replication to keep data synchronized. This master-slave replication system prevents any downtime as the slave (which is a constant live backup of the database) can always be promoted to master if the original master server crashes.
- As the Master-Slave replication is a one-way replication (from master to slave), only the Master database node can accept reads/write while Replica can only accept reads

Problems With This Infrastructure
- The load balancer is a single point of failure as its failure would spell the crashing of this infrastructure
- No firewall on servers
- Traffic is unencrypted owing to the fact there is no TLS (or SSL) to encrypt the HTTP requests and responses
- No monitoring
